% Shell code usages:
%1. to run a test:
runShell -nx=20 -ny=20 -bcType=3 -savePlot -f=<folderName>
(we can run the code without plot using the option -noplot to save time 
or to run remotely on the server without forwarding any images. We can view
the results later locally by using plotSavedResults)

%2. to plot saved results
plotSavedResults -f=<resultsDir> (optional: -contour -nosave)

%3. to see performance profile
viewProfile -f=testResults

%4. to run a convergence study
convRate -case=<caseName> -test=<testName>  (optional -run -noplot)

04/24/2017: coupled system:
runShell -case=coupledSystem -nx=20 -ny=20 -bcType=1  -f=testResults



04/20/2017: created a perl script to do batchRun.pl using multithread.
now we can use batchRun.pl to do all the runs in multithreads:

Somehow the profile won't work in background. It's probabily a matlab issue....
As an alternative, ran in screen, so I can detach from the server.

batchRun.pl > batchRun.log



04/19/2017: to compute convRate:
(to run without plot):
convRate -case=biharmonic -test=biharmTrigTest -run -noplot -rStart=1 -rEnd=6 
convRate -case=biharmonic -test=biharmPolyTest -run  -noplot -rStart=1 -rEnd=6

(to plot without run)
convRate -case=biharmonic -test=biharmTrigTest -rStart=1 -rEnd=6
convRate -case=biharmonic -test=biharmPolyTest -rStart=1 -rEnd=6

04/18/2017: we have two exact solutions: trig and poly 
            (defined in biharmTrigTestRHS.m and  biharmPolyTestRHS.m)
runShell -nx=20 -ny=20 -bcType=3 -savePlot -f=testResults -funcDefFile=biharmPolyTestFuncDef
runShell -nx=20 -ny=20 -bcType=3 -savePlot -f=testResults -funcDefFile=biharmTrigTestFuncDef

04/18/2017: convRate.m is the script to do convergence study automatically.

04/17/2017: add more options to runShell
runShell -nx=20 -ny=20 -bcType=3 -savePlot -f=testResults

04/13/2017
runShell -nx=50 -ny=100 -xa=1 -xb=3 -ya=0 -yb=10
